            <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
            Ever since I was a child, I have been passionate about <span class="highlight">software development</span>. The idea of creating something that can solve real-world problems through code has always fascinated me.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alongside my love for development, I also discovered a natural talent for <span class="highlight">hairdressing</span> at a young age. I realized this talent when I had the chance to plait someone's hair, a moment that was like a dream come true. My journey in hairdressing has been just as creative and rewarding as my journey in tech.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over time, as I learned and watched others style hair, my passion for software development only grew stronger. I have come to understand that my creativity knows no bounds, whether I'm designing a beautiful hairstyle or crafting an elegant user interface.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, I am on a path to becoming a <span class="highlight">UX/UI developer</span>, where I can merge my technical skills with my artistic vision. I believe that my unique combination of passions—software development and creativity in hairdressing—will help me deliver intuitive and aesthetically pleasing user experiences.
